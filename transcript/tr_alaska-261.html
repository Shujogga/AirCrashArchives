15:49:49.3  [Start of recording]

15:49:50.0  SEA-MX    “…I have verified no history on your aircraft in the past thirty days.”
15:49:54.8  CAM-1     [Click]
15:49:57.7  RDO-1     “Yea, we didn’t see anything in the logbook.”
15:50:14.0  CAM-2     “Why don’t you pull your seat forward and I’ll just check this pedestal back there. I don’t think there’s anything else we haven’t checked.”
15:50:22.0  CAM-1     “See, when he’s saying ‘pedestal’… I believe he’s talking about this switch that’s on the pedestal.”
15:50:25.0  CAM-2     “Oh.”
15:50:25.5  CAM-1     “…that’s on the pedestal.”
15:50:27.0  CAM-2     “Yeah, okay.”
15:50:31.0  CAM-1     “Do you see anything back there?”
15:50:32.0  [Click]
15:50:33.0  CAM-2     “Uh, there’s…”
15:50:40.0  SEA-MX    “And two sixty-one, maintenance.”
15:50:42.0  RDO-1     “Go ahead, maintenance two-six-one.”
15:50:44.0  SEA-MX    “Understand you’re requesting diversion to L.A. for this discrepancy. Is there a specific reason you prefer L.A. over San Francisco?”
15:50:45.0  MZT       “Alaska two-six-one radar service terminated… contact Los Angeles Center on 119.95. Good day.”
15:50:54.4  RDO-1     “Well, a lot of times it’s windy and rainy and wet in San Francisco, and it seemed to me that a dry runway—where the wind is usually right down the runway—seemed a little more reasonable.”
15:50:55.0  RDO-2     “119.95, Alaska two-six-one.”
15:51:01.2  RDO-2     “Say again the frequency—119.95?”
15:51:05.0  MZT       “Affirm, 119.95.”
15:51:09.3  RDO-2     “Roger.”
15:51:09.9  SEA-MX    “Okay, and—uh—is this added fuel that you’re going to have in L.A. going to be a complication or an advantage?”
15:51:18.1  RDO-1     “Well, the way I’m reading it—heavier airplanes land faster. Right now I’ve got fifteen-five on board; I’m thinking to land with about twelve, which is still an hour and forty minutes. Those are the numbers I’m running up here.”
15:51:20.6  RDO-2     “L.A., Alaska two-six-one, three-one-zero.”
15:51:36.0  SEA-MX    “Okay, two-six-one, standby for dispatch.”
15:51:38.0  RDO-2     “Los Angeles, Alaska two-six-one, three-one-zero.”
15:51:40.0  RDO-1     “Okay, the other thing you gotta know is they’re talking about holding and delays in San Francisco. For your maintenance planning, L.A. seemed like a smarter move from an airworthiness standpoint.”
15:51:42.0  LAX-CTR1  “Alaska two-six-one, L.A. Center, roger.”
15:51:50.0  RDO-2     “—there’s two people on the frequency, I’m sorry. Alaska two-six-one, I didn’t hear your response.”
15:51:58.0  LAX-CTR1  “Alaska two-six-one, squawk 2010.”
15:52:01.0  RDO-2     “2010, Alaska two-six-one.”
15:52:02.0  SEA-DIS   “Two-six-one, dispatch… current San Francisco weather: 180° at 6 kt, 9 SM, few at 1,500, broken 2,800, overcast 3,400. If you want to land at L.A. for safety reasons we will do that, but know you’ll probably face an hour to an hour-and-a-half delay under the major flow program right now. That’s for ATC back in San Francisco.”
15:52:31.0  RDO-1     “Well, you put me in a spot here…”
15:52:41.0  RDO-1     “I really didn’t want to hear about the flow being the reason you’re calling us, ’cause I’m concerned about overflying suitable airports.”
15:52:51.0  SEA-DIS   “We want to do what’s safe, so if that’s what you feel is safe, we just want to make sure you have all the info.”
15:52:59.0  RDO-1     “Yeah, we kinda assumed that. What’s the wind again at San Francisco?”
15:53:03.0  SEA-DIS   “Wind at SFO currently 180° at 6 kt.”
15:53:08.0  CAM-2     “What runway they landing—10?”
15:53:11.0  RDO-1     “And confirm they’re landing runway 10?”
15:53:15.0  SEA-DIS   “Standby… I’ll confirm that.”
15:53:17.0  CAM-2     “And see if the runways are dry or wet.”
15:53:19.0  RDO-1     “We need to know if they’re dry or wet.”
15:53:21.0  SEA-DIS   “Yeah—correction on that wind: 180° at 6 kt. Standby.”
15:53:28.0  CAM-1     “180 at 6… so that’s runway 16. What we need is runway 19, and they’re not landing 19.”
15:53:35.0  CAM-2     “I don’t think so.”
15:53:37.0  CAM-2     “We might just ask if there’s a ground-school instructor there available—to discuss it with him or a sim instructor.”
15:53:40.0  CAM-1     “Yeah.”
15:53:46.0  RDO-1     “Dispatch 161—we’re wondering if we can get some support out of the internal instructor force… if they’ve got any ideas for us.”
15:53:53.0  RDO-1     “—instructors up there, if they’ve got any ideas.”
15:54:23.0  CAM-1     “You’re talkin’ to ATC, huh?”
15:54:24.0  CAM-2     “Yeah.”
15:54:26.0  CAM-2     “Well, let’s confirm the route of flight—it’s direct Oceanside?”
15:54:32.0  CAM-1     “Tijuana–Oceanside… Oceanside, right… then Santa Catalina.”
15:54:47.0  CAM-1     “Somebody was callin’ in about wheelchairs—”
15:54:50.0  CAM-3     “Oh, really?”
15:54:50.5  CAM-1     “—when I’m workin’ a problem.”
15:54:51.0  CAM-3     “Is that why it went static?”
15:54:53.0  CAM-1     “Okay, yeah—now… that’s something that oughta be in the computers. If they want it that bad, you guys oughta be able to pick up the phone—”
15:55:00.0  CAM-3     “Mmm-hmm.”
15:55:00.5  CAM-1     “—just… drives me nuts. I mean, they think we’re gonna land, fix it, now they’re worried about the flow. I’m sorry, this airplane isn’t gonna go anywhere for a while… so, you know.”
15:55:16.0  CAM-3     “So they’re trying to put the pressure on you—”
15:55:18.0  CAM-1     “Well, no. Yeah.”
15:55:19.0  CAM-3     “—well, get it to where it needs to be.”
15:55:20.0  CAM-1     “And actually it doesn’t matter that much to us.”
15:55:23.0  CAM-3     “Still not gonna go out on time to the next—”
15:55:24.0  CAM-1     “Yeah… yeah… I thought they’d cover the people better from L.A.—”
15:55:29.0  CAM-3     “L.A.”
15:55:30.0  CAM-1     “—than SFO.”
15:55:32.0  RDO-2     “L.A., Alaska two-six-one—just confirm our routing after Tijuana is direct Oceanside?”
15:55:38.0  LAX-CTR1  “Alaska two-six-one, after Tijuana, cleared to San Francisco via direct San Marcos Jet 501, Big Sur direct, maintain FL310.”
15:55:47.0  RDO-2     “OK… San Francisco via San Marcos Jet 501, Big Sur direct, FL310, Alaska 261.”
15:55:55.0  LAX-CTR1  “(unspecified transmission).”
15:56:03.0  SEA-DIS   “Alaska 261, dispatch.”
15:56:06.0  RDO-1     “Dispatch, Alaska 261, go ahead.”
15:56:08.0  SEA-DIS   “Yeah, I called ATIS—runways 28R and 28L, and wasn’t able to get the runway report, but looking at the past weather it hasn’t rained in hours, so I’m expecting a dry runway.”
15:56:21.0  RDO-1     “OK.”
15:56:26.0  RDO-1     “With the info I have—and waiting on that CG update—I’m looking at an approach speed of 180 kt. Do you have wind at LAX?”
15:56:50.0  SEA-DIS   “It’s 260° at 9 kt.”
15:56:56.0  RDO-1     “OK, 260 at 9… versus the direct crosswind with effectively no change in groundspeed… I gotta tell you, from a safety point I think something that lowers my groundspeed makes sense.”
15:57:16.0  SEA-DIS   “OK, 261—that means LAX then. If you can call LAX with that info, they can probably whip out the CG for you real quick.”
15:57:30.0  RDO-1     “I suspect that’s what we’ll do. Plan is: we’ll proceed as if to SFO, get all that data, then descend back into LAX at a lower altitude so we can configure and check handling before we proceed with the approach.”
15:58:05.0  SEA-DIS   “OK, 261 dispatch copied—if you can now keep LAX Ops updated on your ETA, that’d be great. I’ll talk with them.”
15:58:15.0  RDO-1     “OK, I’ll let them know we’re coming in here. I think they’ll listen as we talk… we’re gonna stay up here burn off more gas, then talk to LAX when we start descent.”
15:58:29.0  SEA-DIS   “OK, and if you have any problems getting CG, give me a call back.”
15:58:34.0  RDO-1     “OK. Break. LAX, do you read, Alaska 261?”
15:58:39.0  LAX-OPS  “261, I do copy—do you have an ETA for me?”
15:58:43.0  RDO-1     “Well… I’m gonna put it at about thirty-thirty-five minutes. The longer, the more fuel I burn off the better—but I wonder if you can compute our current CG based on info we had at takeoff.”
15:58:58.0  LAX-OPS  “OK, your transmission is coming in broken but go ahead.”
15:59:02.0  RDO-1     “You know what—I’ll wait a minute; we’ll be a bit closer, that’ll help everything.”
15:59:06.0  LAX-OPS  “Also, 261—since you’re an international arrival we have to get landing rights. I don’t know how long that’ll take… I have to clear it all through customs first.”
15:59:19.0  RDO-1     “OK, I understand—better start that now ’cause we are headed to you.”
15:59:26.0  LAX-OPS  “Copy.”
15:59:29.0  CAM-1     “We’ll call ’em back over as we get closer to Catalina.”
15:59:34.0  CAM-2     “As we get what?”
15:59:34.5  CAM-1     “Closer to L.A.—she’s gotta get landing rights.”
15:59:37.0  CAM-2     “We’re ninety-four miles from L.A. now.”
15:59:38.0  CAM-1     “Oh, OK. You wanna listen to the ATIS?”
15:59:42.0  CAM-2     “In fact I switched it once already—just kinda late.”
15:59:44.0  CAM-1     “You got the ATIS?”
15:59:44.5  CAM-2     “I got it.”
15:59:50.0  ATIS      “Charlie 5 and Charlie 6 taxiway restricted… read back runway hold-short… initial contact… Information Mike… Charlie 25 00 Z… wind 230° 8 kt… vis 8 SM… few 2,800, scattered 12,000, overcast 20,000… temp 16, dew 11, alt 30.17… simultaneous ILS approaches runway 24R/25L… visual approaches… etc.”
16:01:01.0  CAM-2     “So he wanted us to go to SFO initially?”
16:01:06.0  CAM-1     “To keep the schedule alive. I mean, it was… he had all the reasons to do it. I stated concern about overflying a suitable airport—”
16:01:15.0  CAM-2     “Yeah.”
16:01:16.0  CAM-1     “—but I was listening. Then when he gives me the wind, it was a ninety-degree cross at ten kt on 28, and we’d be landing on—”
16:01:30.0  CAM-2     “And they are using 19?”
16:01:33.0  CAM-1     “I don’t know… I wrote it down—winds were 180 at 6…”
16:01:49.0  CAM-2     “I don’t know.”
16:01:49.5  CAM-1     “I don’t care… you know what? I expect him to figure all that shit—”
16:01:53.0  CAM-2     “Right.”
16:01:53.5  CAM-1     “—he’s got it on the screen—”
16:01:54.0  CAM-2     “That’s why I was thinking an instructor would really cut through the crap there.”
16:01:58.0  CAM-1     “Yeah.”
16:01:58.5  CAM-2     “Not available?”
16:02:00.0  CAM-1     “Well, they just don’t talk to each other.”
16:02:02.0  CAM-2     “Oh.”
16:02:02.5  CAM-1     “I mean, I—”
16:02:04.0  CAM-2     “They’ve always told us they were available… anytime you have a problem.”
16:02:06.0  CAM-1     “Yeah, yeah.”
16:02:07.0  CAM-2     “If they get one down there.”
16:02:12.6  RDO-1     “Los Angeles one-six-one—do you read me better now?”
16:02:29.0  CAM-1     “I got the track goin’ over there.”
16:02:31.0  LAX-OPS  “Go ahead, two-six-one.”
16:02:33.6  RDO-1     “261—I know you’re busy on us, but we’re discussing it—could you give us the winds at SFO if you could just pull ’em up on your screen?”
16:02:57.0  CAM-2     “I thought they—”
16:03:00.0  LAX-OPS  “OK… San Francisco—winds are 170° at 6 kt.”
16:03:15.6  RDO-1     “OK, thank you—that’s what I needed. We are comin’ in to see you… and I’ve misplaced the paperwork here.”
16:03:23.0  CAM-2     “There it is.”
16:03:35.0  CAM-1     “I can’t read your writing… can you read her the zero-fuel weight—and all those numbers and CG?”
16:03:40.0  CAM-2     “Yeah.”
16:03:41.0  CAM-1     “—and CG.”
16:03:43.0  LAX-OPS  “L.A. operations from 261.”
16:03:48.0  CAM-2     “I got it.”
16:03:48.5  RDO-2     “Uh, 261… do you need our numbers?”
16:03:52.0  LAX-OPS  “Yeah, we just want to advise that we do not have landing rights yet.”
16:03:56.0  RDO-2     “Here’s our numbers: ten in first class, seventy in coach; zero-fuel weight 102,110.1 lb; fuel on board 34.9 K lb; takeoff weight 136,511.8 lb; CG 11.8.”
16:04:19.0  LAX-OPS  “OK, I got ten and seventy; ZFW 102,110.1; fuel 34.9; TOW 136,511.8; CG 11.8.”
16:04:32.0  RDO-2     “Takeoff weight 136,511.8; CG 11.8; we currently have 13,600 lb of fuel on board.”
16:04:43.0  CAM-1     “Estimate ten thousand on landing.”
16:04:45.0  RDO-2     “Estimating ten thousand on landing.”
16:04:53.0  LAX-OPS  “OK, you said your takeoff weight was… 115,111.8?”
16:04:58.0  RDO-2     “136,511.8.”
16:05:05.0  LAX-OPS  “136,511.8—thank you.”
16:05:07.0  RDO-2     “We’re currently 115,700 on our weight, and we’ll burn another 3,000.”
16:05:19.0  CAM      [Two clicks]
16:05:27.0  CAM-2   “I’m back on the… I’m off of the company.”
16:06:26.0  CAM-1   “No… that’s what I was expecting them to do. Duh.”
16:06:47.0  CAM-2   “So our landing speed will be 148 plus… some additive, right?”
16:07:06.0  CAM-1   “Let’s guess… 112.”
16:07:10.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:07:10.2  CAM-1   “146 plus… I get a minus-2, worst case… 24 kt… 50 60 70…”
16:07:33.0  LAX-OPS  “Alaska 261 from operations—can you give us your tail number?”
16:07:38.0  RDO-1   “261—it was ship 963.”
16:07:43.0  LAX-OPS  “Copy that—your aircraft number is 963.”
16:07:47.0  RDO-1   “Affirmative, thank you.”
16:07:51.0  LAX-MX-1  “And two-six-one, maintenance?”
16:07:53.0  RDO-1   “261, go.”
16:07:54.0  LAX-MX-1  “Yeah, are you guys with the horizontal situation?”
16:07:58.0  RDO-1   “Affirmative.”
16:07:59.0  LAX-MX-1  “Yeah, did you try the suitcase handles and the pickle switches, right?”
16:08:03.0  RDO-1   “Yeah, we tried everything—if you’ve got any hidden breakers we’d love to know about ’em.”
16:08:14.0  LAX-MX-1  “I’ll look at the circuit-breaker guide as a double-check. Yeah, I wanted to know if you tried the pickle switches and suitcase handles together or individually.”
16:08:29.9  RDO-1   “We tried just about every iteration.”
16:08:32.0  LAX-MX-1  “And alternate’s inop too, huh?”
16:08:35.1  RDO-1   “Yup—it appears jammed. On primary we get AC load—motor’s trying to run but brake won’t move. On alternate, nothing happens.”
16:08:50.0  LAX-MX-1  “OK, you say you get a spike on the meter when using primary—no appreciable change on alternate, correct?”
16:08:59.0  CAM-1   “I’m gonna click it off—got it?”
16:09:00.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:09:01.5  RDO-1   “Affirmative—we get a spike on primary but no change on alternate.”
16:09:09.0  LAX-MX-1  “OK, thank you—see you at the gate.”
16:09:11.0  RDO-1   “OK.”
16:09:13.0  CAM-1   “Let’s do that.”
16:09:14.8  [Click]
16:09:14.8  CAM-1   “This’ll click it off.”

16:09:21.0  CAM-1   “You got it… # me.”
16:09:24.0  CAM-2   “What are you doin’?”

16:09:25.4  CAWS     [Chime] “Altitude”
16:09:26.0  CAM-1   “—it got worse… OK.”
16:09:30.0  [Vibration begins]
16:09:31.0  CAM-1   “You’re stalled.”
16:09:32.0  [Vibration louder]
16:09:33.0  CAM-1   “No, no—you gotta release it. You gotta release it.”
16:09:34.0  [Click]
16:09:34.0  [Vibration ends]
16:09:42.4  CAM-1   “Let’s—speedbrake.”
16:09:46.0  CAM-1   “Gimme high-pressure pumps.”
16:09:52.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:09:52.0  CAM-1   “Help me back—help me back.”
16:09:54.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:09:55.0  RDO-1   “Center, Alaska 261—we are in a dive here.”

16:10:20.0  CAM-1   “Just help me.”
16:10:22.0  CAM-1   “Once we get the speed slowed maybe… we’ll be OK.”
16:10:28.2  RDO-1   “We’re at 23,700—request…”
16:10:33.0  RDO-1   “Yeah, we got it back under control here.”
16:10:34.0  RDO-2   “No we don’t—OK.”
16:10:37.0  CAM-1   “OK.”
16:10:37.0  LAX-CTR1 “The altitude you’d like to remain at?”
16:10:40.0  [Click]
16:10:45.0  CAM-2   “Let’s take the speedbrakes off—I’m—”
16:10:46.0  CAM-1   “No, leave ’em there. Seems to be helping.”
16:10:51.0  CAM-1   “# me.”
16:10:53.0  CAWS     [Chime] “Altitude”
16:10:55.0  CAM-1   “OK, it really wants to pitch down.”
16:10:58.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:10:59.0  CAM-1   “Don’t mess with that.”
16:11:04.0  CAM-2   “I agree with you.”
16:11:04.0  LAX-CTR1 “Alaska 261, say your condition.”
16:11:06.6  RDO-1   “Two-six-one—we are at 24,000 ft, kinda stabilized.”
16:11:10.0  RDO-1   “We’re slowing here, and we’re gonna do a little troubleshooting. Can you give me a block between 20 and 25?”
16:11:21.0  LAX-CTR1 “Alaska 261, maintain block altitude FL200 through FL250.”
16:11:27.0  RDO-1   “Alaska 261—we’ll take that block; we’ll monitor the freq.”
16:11:31.0  CAM-2   “You have the airplane—let me just try it.”
16:11:33.0  CAM-1   “OK.”
16:11:33.0  CAM-2   “How hard is it?”
16:11:33.0  CAM-1   “I don’t know—my adrenaline’s goin’… it was really tough there for a while.”
16:11:38.0  CAM-2   “Yeah it is.”
16:11:39.0  CAM-1   “OK.”
16:11:43.0  CAM-2   “Whatever we did is no good—don’t do that again.”
16:11:44.0  CAM-1   “Yeah, no—it went down to full nose-down.”
16:11:48.0  CAM-2   “Uh, it’s a lot worse than it was?”
16:11:50.0  CAM-1   “Yeah, yeah—we’re in much worse shape now.”
16:11:59.0  CAM-1   “I think it’s at the stop—full stop. And I’m thinking, can it go any worse? Probably can… but when we slowed down, let’s slow it, let’s get down to 200 kt and see what happens.”
16:12:16.0  CAM-2   “OK?”
16:12:16.0  [Click]
16:12:17.0  CAM-2   “We have to put the slats out and everything—flaps and slats.”
16:12:20.0  CAM-1   “Yeah… well, we’ll wait. OK, you got it for a second?”
16:12:23.0  CAM-2   “Yeah.”
16:12:25.3  RDO-1   “Maintenance two-six-one—are you on?”
16:12:30.0  LAX-MX-2 “Yeah, 261—this is maintenance.”
16:12:32.0  RDO-1   “OK—we did both pickle switch and suitcase handles and it ran away full nose-down.”
16:12:39.0  LAX-MX-2 “Oh, it ran away trim down?”
16:12:42.0  RDO-1   “And now we’re in a pinch, worse than before.”
16:12:50.0  LAX-MX-2 “OK… geez.”
16:12:52.0  LAX-MX-1 “You want me to talk to ’em?”
16:12:55.0  LAX-MX-1 “261—maintenance: you’re getting full nose trim down, but no nose-up trim—correct?”
16:13:04.0  RDO-1   “Affirm—we went to full nose-down and I’m afraid to try it again to see if it’ll go the other way.”
16:13:10.0  LAX-MX-1 “OK—well, discretion’s yours if you want to try, if not that’s fine. We’ll see you at the gate.”
16:13:20.0  CAM-2   “Did it happen in reverse? When you pulled back it went forward?”
16:13:22.0  CAM-1   “I went to tab down… right—and it should have come back; instead it went the other way.”
16:13:29.0  CAM-2   “Uh-huh.”
16:13:30.0  CAM-1   “What do you think?”
16:13:32.0  CAM-2   “Uhhh…”
16:13:32.5  CAM-1   “You wanna try it or not?”
16:13:32.9  CAM-2   “Uhh no… I don’t know.”
16:13:33.0  CAM-1   “It’s up to you, man.”
16:13:35.0  CAM-2   “Let’s head back that way—let’s see… well we’re—”
16:13:39.0  CAM-1   “I like going out over the water myself… I don’t like going this fast though.”
16:13:50.0  [Click]
16:13:57.0  CAM-1   “OK, you got—[short interruption]—second?”
16:13:58.0  CAM-2   “Yeah.”
16:13:59.0  CAM-2   “We better talk to the people in the back.”
16:14:03.0  CAM-1   “Yeah, I know.”
16:14:04.0  LAX-CTR1 “Alaska 261, let me know if you need anything.”
16:14:08.0  RDO-2   “Yeah, we’re still working this.”
16:14:12.0  PA-1    “Folks, we have had a flight-control problem up front here—we’re working it. L.A. is off to the right—that’s where we’re intending to go. We’re pretty busy up here working this situation; I don’t anticipate any big problems once we get a couple subsystems online. We will be going into LAX, and I’d anticipate us parking there in about 20–30 minutes.”
16:14:39.0  CAM-1   “OK… speedbrakes—did they have any effect?”
16:14:49.0  CAM-1   “Let’s put power where it’ll be for 1.2, for landing. You buy that?”
16:14:53.0  CAM-1   “Slow it down and see what happens.”
16:14:54.0  LAX-CTR1 “Alaska 261, contact L.A. Center on 126.52—they are aware of your situation.”
16:15:00.0  RDO-2   “OK, Alaska 261—say again frequency, 126.52?”
16:15:02.0  CAM-1   “I got the yoke.”
16:15:04.0  LAX-CTR1 “Alaska 261, 126.52.”
16:15:06.0  RDO-2   “Thank you.”
16:15:07.0  LAX-CTR1 “You’re welcome—have a good day.”
16:15:19.7  RDO-2   “L.A., Alaska 261—we’re with you at 22,500 ft; we have a jammed stabilizer and we’re maintaining altitude with difficulty, but we can maintain. Our intention is to land at LAX.”
16:15:36.0  LAX-CTR2 “Alaska 261, L.A. Center, roger. You’re cleared to Los Angeles airport via present position direct Santa Monica, direct Los Angeles. Do you want lower now or what do you want, sir?”
16:15:54.0  CAM-1   “Let me get it—let me have it.”
16:15:56.0  RDO-1   “Center, Alaska 261—I need to get down about ten, change my configuration, make sure I can control the jet, and I’d like to do that out here over the bay if I may.”
16:16:07.0  LAX-CTR2 “OK, Alaska 261, roger—standby here.”
16:16:11.0  CAM-2   “Let’s do it at this altitude instead of going to ten—”
16:16:11.5  CAM-1   “What?”
16:16:12.0  CAM-2   “—’cause the airflow’s that much different down at ten. This air’s thin enough, you know what I’m sayin’?”
16:16:20.0  CAM-2   “Yeah—uh, I’ll tell ’em to—”
16:16:22.0  CAM-1   “I just made a PA to everyone to get everybody—”
16:16:24.0  CAM-2   “OK.”
16:16:26.0  CAM-1   “—down. You might call the flight attendants.”
16:16:27.0  [Cockpit-door sound]
16:16:32.0  CAM-3   “I was just comin’ up this way.”
16:16:32.0  LAX-CTR2 “Alaska 261, fly heading 280 and descend and maintain 17,000.”
16:16:34.0  CAM-2   “Uhh…”
16:16:36.0  [Cockpit-door sound]
16:16:39.0  RDO-1   “280 and 17,000, Alaska 261—and we generally need a block altitude.”
16:16:45.0  LAX-CTR2 “OK—and I tell you what: do that for now, sir, and contact L.A. Center on 135.5—they’ll have further instructions for you, sir.”
16:16:56.9  RDO-2   “OK, 135.5—say altimeter setting?”
16:16:59.0  LAX-CTR2 “The L.A. altimeter is 30.18.”
16:17:01.0  CAM-1   “I need everything picked up—”
16:17:02.0  RDO-2   “Thank you.”
16:17:02.0  CAM-1   “—and everybody strapped down—”
16:17:04.0  CAM-3   “OK.”
16:17:04.0  CAM-1   “—’cause I’m gonna unload the airplane and see if we can—”
16:17:06.0  CAM-3   “OK.”
16:17:07.0  CAM-1   “—regain control of it that way.”
16:17:09.0  CAM-3   “OK—we had a big bang back there—”
16:17:11.0  CAM-1   “Yeah, I heard it—”
16:17:12.0  CAM-3   “OK.”
16:17:12.0  CAM-1   “—the stab trim, I think it—”
16:17:13.0  CAM-2   “You heard it in the back?”
16:17:13.5  CAM-3   “Yeah.”
16:17:14.0  CAM-2   “Yeah.”
16:17:15.0  CAM-3   “So—”
16:17:15.5  CAM-1   “I think the stab trim thing is broke—”
16:17:17.0  CAM-3   “—I didn’t wanna call you guys, but—”
16:17:18.0  CAM-1   “No, no—that’s good.”
16:17:20.0  CAM-3   “—that girl, they’re like ‘you better go up there’—”
16:17:21.0  CAM-1   “I need everybody strapped in now, dear.”
16:17:22.0  CAM-3   “—and tell them.”
16:17:23.0  CAM-3   “OK.”
16:17:24.0  CAM-1   “’Cause I’m gonna release the back pressure and see if I can get it back.”
16:17:30.0  [Cockpit-door sound]
16:17:33.0  CAM-2   “30.18.”
16:17:37.0  CAM-1   “I’ll get it here.”
16:17:40.0  CAM-2   “I don’t think you want any more speedbrakes, do you?”
16:17:42.0  CAM-1   “Uhh, no. Actually—”
16:17:46.0  CAM-2   “He wants us to maintain 17.”
16:17:51.0  CAM-1   “OK—I need help with this here.”
16:17:52.0  CAM-1   “Slats extend—let’s—”
16:17:54.0  CAM-2   “OK, slats—”
16:17:54.5  CAM-1   “Gimme slats extend.”
16:17:55.0  CAM-2   “Got it.”

16:17:58.0  CAM-1   “I’m test-flying now—”
16:17:59.0  CAM-2   “How does it feel?”
16:18:00.0  CAM-1   “It wants to pitch over more on you.”
16:18:02.0  CAM-2   “Really?”
16:18:03.0  CAM-1   “Yeah.”
16:18:04.0  CAM-2   “Try flaps—15, 11?”
16:18:05.0  CAM-1   “Ah, let’s go to 11.”
16:18:07.3  [Slat/flap handle sound]
16:18:09.0  CAM-2   “OK… get some power on.”
16:18:10.0  CAM-1   “I’m at 250 kt, so I’m lookin’…”
16:18:17.0  CAM-2   “Real hard?”
16:18:17.5  CAM-1   “No, actually it’s pretty stable—see, but we gotta get down to 180.”
16:18:26.0  CAM-1   “OK… bring the flaps and slats back up for me.”
16:18:32.0  CAM-2   “Slats too?”
16:18:33.0  CAM-1   “Yeah.”
16:18:36.8  [Slat/flap handle sound]
16:18:37.0  CAM-2   “That gives us 12,000 lb of fuel—don’t over-boost them.”
16:18:47.0  CAM-1   “What I wanna do—”
16:18:48.0  [Slat/flap handle sound]
16:18:49.0  CAM-1   “—is get the nose up, and then let the nose fall through and see if we can stab it when it’s unloaded.”

16:19:01.0  CAM-1   “It’s on the stop now—it’s on the stop.”
16:19:04.0  CAM-2   “Well, not according to that—it’s not.”
16:19:07.0  CAM-2   “The trim might be, and then if something’s popped back there it might be mechanical damage too.”
16:19:11.0  CAM-1   “Yeah.”
16:19:11.5  CAM-2   “So if it’s controllable, we oughta just try to land it—”
16:19:16.0  CAM-1   “You think so? OK, let’s head for L.A.”
16:19:21.1  [Thump]
