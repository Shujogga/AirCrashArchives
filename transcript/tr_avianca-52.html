      <pre>

2103:07	Radio:	New York approach Avianca zero five ah two leveling five thousand.
2103:11	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, New York approach good evening, fly heading zero six zero.
2103:15	Radio:	Heading zero six zero, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2103:18	CAM-2:	Zero six zero on the heading.
2103:46	CAM-3:	When we have...with thousand pounds or less in any tank, it is necessary to do.
2103:53	CAM-2:	Yes sir.
2103:56	CAM-3:	Then the go-around procedure is stating that the power be applied slowly and to avoid rapid accelerations and to have a minimum of nose up attitude.
2104:09	CAM-1:	To maintain what?
2104:10	CAM-2:	Minimum, minimum nose up attitude, that means the less nose up attitude that one can hold.
2104:10	CAM-3:	This thing is going okay.
2104:27	CAM-3:	Then flaps to twenty five position and maintain vee ref plus twenty...The highest go around procedure is starting.
2104:34	CAM-3:	The flaps, sorry, retract the landing gear with positive rate of climb...if any low pressure light comes on do not select the switch in the off position...the low pressure lights of the pumps comes on, reduce the nose up altitude, the nose up attitude.
2104:57	CAM-3:	The forward pumps...
2104:59	CAM-1:	What heading do you have over there?
2105:04	CAM-1:	Select Kennedy on my side.
2105:04	CAM-2:	Kennedy is on the number two, but if want Commander, I can perform the radio setup right now that we are now being vectored, we are like on down wind position now.
2105:11	CAM-1:	We passed already, no?
2105:12	CAM-2:	Yes sir.
2105:13	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy turn left, heading three six zero.
2105:17	Radio:	Left, heading three six zero, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2105:22	CAM-3:	Three six zero.
2105:24	CAM-2:	Yes Commander, thats what he say.
2105:26	CAM-1:	Perform the radio setup, but leave to me the VOR, the in Kennedy, then select here, tell me what.
2105:34	CAM-1:	Two what?.
2105:34	CAM-2:	Two twenty three.
2105:35	CAM-	*sound of altitude alert tone*
2105:38	CAM-1:	Two twenty three.
2105:39	CAM-1:	What heading he provide us?
2105:42	CAM-2:	New, he give us three six zero.
2105:42	CAM-1:	Okay.
2105:42	CAM-2:	I am going to perform the radio setup on number two.
2105:42	CAM-1:	Perform the radio setup.
2105:49	CAM-	*sound of landing gear warning horn*
2105:52	CAM-1:	Hey, understand that the nose must be maintained as low as possible, yes?
2105:52	CAM-3:	That's correct, it says that the forward pumps...
2106:02	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, turn left heading of three zero zero.
2106:04	Radio:	Left heading three zero zero, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2106:09	CAM-2:	Three zero zero on the heading.
2106:10	CAM-3:	The forward boost pumps could be uncovered on fuel during the go around.
2106:15	CAM-3:	What it means it doesn't contain fuel for feeding itself and a flameout can occur...and it is necessary to lower the nose again.
2106:44	CAM-1:	Heading three hundred.
2106:45	CAM-2:	Three hundred.
2106:51	CAM-2:	Right now we are proceeding to the airport inbound and we have twentyseven, seventeen miles.
2106:58	CAM-3:	Roger.
2107:04	CAM-2:	This means that we'll have hamburger tonight.
2107:17	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, turn left heading two niner.
2107:20	Radio:	Left heading two niner zero, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2107:24	CAM-2:	Two niner zero on the heading please.
2107:29	CAM-1:	Two twenty three course counter standby the frequency number.
2107:32	CAM-2:	Standby for the frequency.
2107:34	CAM-1:	Leave the ILS frequency in Kennedy until I advise you select your own there.
2107:36	CAM-2:	It is ready.
2107:37	CAM-1:	Well...
2107:42	CAM-2:	Markers are set.
2108:34	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, descend and maintain, ahh, descend and maintain three thousand.
2108:40	Radio:	Descend and maintain three thousand, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2108:40	CAM-2:	Three thousand feet.
2109:01	CAM-1:	The localizer, are we going to intercept it with two thousand?
2109:06	CAM-2:	Yes, the initial approach altitude is two thousand or according to the ATC.
2109:11	CAM-3:	They got us, they already vectoring us.
2109:21	CAM-2:	They accommodate us ahead of an....
2109:27	CAM-1:	What?
2109:27	CAM-2:	They accommodate us.
2109:29	CAM-3:	They already know that we are in bad condition.
2109:30	CAM-1:	No, they are descending us.
2109:35	CAM-2:	One thousand feet.
2109:36	CAM-1:	Ah yes.

2110:16	CAM-1:	Standby for the localizer there.
2110:18	CAM-2:	Yes Sir.
2110:21	CAM-2:	Outer marker is seven miles.
2110:21	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, turn left heading two five zero, intercept the localizer.
2110:31	Radio:	Heading two five zero, intercept the localizer, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2110:37	CAM-2:	Two fifty is the heading to intercept the localizer.
2111:04	CAM-2:	This is final vector, do you want the ILS Commander?
2111:07	Approach:	Avianca zero five two heavy, you are one five miles from the outer marker, maintain two thousand until established on the localizer, cleared ILS two two left.
2111:14	Radio:	Cleared ILS two two left, maintain two thousand until established, Avianca zero five two heavy.
2111:14	CAM-3:	Two thousand.
2111:16	CAM-1:	Select the ILS on my side.
2111:20	CAM-2:	The ILS in number one, one hundred ten point nine is set.
2111:29	CAM-2:	For two thousand feet.
2111:29	CAM-3:	Localizer alive.
2111:32	CAM-1:	Give me flaps fourteen.
2111:33	CAM-2:	We are thirteen miles from the outer marker.
