[21:03:07] RDO-?:  New York approach, Avianca 052 heavy, leveling 5,000.  
[21:03:11] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, New York approach, good evening. Fly heading 060.  
[21:03:15] RDO-?:  Heading 060, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:03:18] CAM-2:  “Zero six zero on the heading.”  
[21:03:46] CAM-3:  “When we have a thousand pounds or less in any tank, it is necessary to do…”  
[21:03:53] CAM-2:  “Yes, sir.”  
[21:03:56] CAM-3:  “Then the go-around procedure says apply power slowly, avoid rapid accelerations, and maintain a minimum nose-up attitude.”  
[21:04:09] CAM-1:  “To maintain what?”  
[21:04:10] CAM-2:  “Minimum nose-up attitude—meaning as little nose-up as you can hold.”  
[21:04:10] CAM-3:  “This thing is going okay.”  
[21:04:27] CAM-3:  “Then flaps to 25 and maintain Vref plus 20… The highest go-around procedure starts.”  
[21:04:34] CAM-3:  “Retract the gear with a positive climb. If any low-pressure pump light comes on, do not switch it off. Reduce nose-up attitude when the pump light indicates.”  
[21:04:57] CAM-3:  “The forward pumps…”  
[21:04:59] CAM-1:  “What heading do you have over there?”  
[21:05:04] CAM-1:  “Select Kennedy on my side.”  
[21:05:04] CAM-2:  “Kennedy is on NAV 2, but if you want, Commander, I can set up the radios now. We’re being vectored, downwind position.”  
[21:05:11] CAM-1:  “We passed already, no?”  
[21:05:12] CAM-2:  “Yes, sir.”  
[21:05:13] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, turn left heading 360.  
[21:05:17] RDO-?:  Left heading 360, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:05:22] CAM-3:  “Three-six-zero.”  
[21:05:24] CAM-2:  “Yes, Commander, that’s what he said.”  
[21:05:26] CAM-1:  “Set up the radios, but leave me the VOR in Kennedy. Tell me when.”  
[21:05:34] CAM-1:  “Two—what?”  
[21:05:34] CAM-2:  “Two-two-three.”  
[21:05:35] CAM-?:  [Altitude-alert tone]  
[21:05:38] CAM-1:  “Two-two-three.”  
[21:05:39] CAM-1:  “What heading did he give us?”  
[21:05:42] CAM-2:  “He gave us 360.”  
[21:05:42] CAM-1:  “Okay.”  
[21:05:42] CAM-2:  “I’m going to perform the radio setup on NAV 2.”  
[21:05:42] CAM-1:  “Do it.”  
[21:05:49] CAM-?:  [Landing-gear warning horn]  
[21:05:52] CAM-1:  “Hey, remember to keep the nose as low as possible, yes?”  
[21:05:52] CAM-3:  “That’s correct.”  
[21:06:02] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, turn left heading 300.  
[21:06:04] RDO-?:  Left heading 300, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:06:09] CAM-2:  “Three-zero-zero on the heading.”  
[21:06:10] CAM-3:  “The forward boost pumps could be uncovered on fuel during the go-around.”  
[21:06:15] CAM-3:  “If they run dry, a flameout can occur—you must lower the nose again.”  
[21:06:44] CAM-1:  “Heading 300.”  
[21:06:45] CAM-2:  “Three-hundred.”  
[21:06:51] CAM-2:  “Right now we are inbound, 27.17 miles.”  
[21:06:58] CAM-3:  “Roger.”  
[21:07:04] CAM-2:  “This means we’ll have hamburgers tonight.”  
[21:07:17] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, turn left heading 290.  
[21:07:20] RDO-?:  Left heading 290, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:07:24] CAM-2:  “Two-nine-zero on the heading, please.”  
[21:07:29] CAM-1:  “Set 223 course, standby for the frequency.”  
[21:07:32] CAM-2:  “Standby for the frequency.”  
[21:07:34] CAM-1:  “Leave the ILS in Kennedy until I tell you to select yours.”  
[21:07:36] CAM-2:  “It is ready.”  
[21:07:37] CAM-1:  “Well…”  
[21:07:42] CAM-2:  “Markers are set.”  
[21:08:34] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, descend and maintain 3,000.  
[21:08:40] RDO-?:  Descend and maintain 3,000, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:08:40] CAM-2:  “Three thousand feet.”  
[21:09:01] CAM-1:  “The localizer—are we intercepting it at 2,000?”  
[21:09:06] CAM-2:  “Yes—initial approach altitude is 2,000 per ATC.”  
[21:09:11] CAM-3:  “They’ve vectored us already.”  
[21:09:21] CAM-2:  “They’re accommodating us ahead of….”  
[21:09:27] CAM-1:  “What?”  
[21:09:27] CAM-2:  “They’re accommodating us.”  
[21:09:29] CAM-3:  “They know we’re in bad condition.”  
[21:09:30] CAM-1:  “No—they’re descending us.”  
[21:09:35] CAM-2:  “One thousand feet.”  
[21:09:36] CAM-1:  “Ah, yes.”  
[21:09:38] CAM-2:  “They’re giving us priority.”  
[21:09:44] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, turn left heading 270.  
[21:09:47] RDO-?:  Left heading 270.  
[21:09:50] CAM-2:  “Two-seven-zero on the heading.”  
[21:09:54] CAM-1:  “Two-seventy.”  
[21:10:03] CAM-2:  “It’s ahead of us.”  
[21:10:05] CAM-3:  “Yes.”  
[21:10:16] CAM-1:  “Standby for the localizer.”  
[21:10:18] CAM-2:  “Yes, sir.”  
[21:10:21] CAM-2:  “Outer marker in seven miles.”  
[21:10:21] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, turn left heading 250, intercept localizer.  
[21:10:31] RDO-?:  Heading 250, intercept localizer, Avianca 052 heavy.  
[21:10:37] CAM-2:  “Two-fifty to intercept the localizer.”  
[21:11:04] CAM-2:  “This is final vector—Commander, do you want the ILS?”  
[21:11:07] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, 1.5 miles from outer marker, maintain 2,000 until established, cleared ILS 22 L.  
[21:11:14] RDO-?:  Cleared ILS 22 L, maintain 2,000 until established.  
[21:11:14] CAM-3:  “Two thousand.”  
[21:11:16] CAM-1:  “Select the ILS on my side.”  
[21:11:20] CAM-2:  “NAV 1, 110.9 is set.”  
[21:11:29] CAM-2:  “For 2,000 ft.”  
[21:11:29] CAM-3:  “Localizer alive.”  
[21:11:32] CAM-1:  “Give me flaps 14.”  
[21:11:33] CAM-2:  “We’re 13 nm from the marker.”  
[21:11:33] CAM-2:  “Flaps 14.”  
[21:11:47] CAM-1:  “NAV 1.”  
[21:11:49] CAM-1:  “Did you set flaps 14?”  
[21:11:51] CAM-2:  “Yes, sir—set.”  
[21:11:53] CAM-2:  “NAV 1.”  
[21:11:55] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, speed 160 if practical.  
[21:11:57] CAM-3:  “14.”  
[21:11:59] RDO-?:  “160, Avianca 052 heavy.”  
[21:12:05] CAM-1:  “Give me flaps 25.”  
[21:12:06] CAM-2:  “Flaps 25.”  
[21:12:09] CAM-2:  “Reduce to minimum.”  
[21:12:15] CAM-2:  “Traffic ahead of us.”  
[21:12:28] CAM-1:  “We can do 140 with this flap.”  
[21:12:52] CAM-1:  “How many miles to that marker?”  
[21:12:53] CAM-2:  “Seven miles—10 nm from the marker now.”  
[21:13:25] CAM-1:  “Reset ILS frequency, please.”  
[21:13:29] CAM-2:  “Okay.”  
[21:13:34] CAM-1:  “Thank you.”  
[21:13:47] CAM-2:  “We’ll intercept the course at the outer marker—no problem, Commander.”  
[21:14:00] CAM-2:  “Localizer left.”  
[21:15:08] APPR:   Avianca 052 heavy, contact Kennedy Tower 119.1, good day.  
[21:15:12] RDO-?:  “119.1—so long.”  
[21:15:19] RDO-?:  “Kennedy Tower, Avianca 052 established 22 L.”  
[21:15:23] TWR:    Avianca 052 heavy, Kennedy Tower. You’re number three following 727 on nine-mile final.  
[21:15:32] RDO-?:  “Roger.”  
[21:16:19] CAM-1:  “Can I lower the gear yet?”  
[21:16:21] CAM-2:  “No, too early.”  
[21:16:53] CAM-2:  “If we lower gear, we must hold a high nose attitude.”  
[21:16:53] CAM-3:  “And it’s not very…”  
[21:16:56] TWR:    American 692, runway 22 L, wind 190° at 21 kt, cleared to land.  
[21:17:01] AA 692:  “Cleared to land, American 692.”  
[21:17:17] TWR:    Avianca 052, what’s your airspeed?  
[21:17:20] RDO-?:  “Avianca 052, 140 kt.”  
[21:17:25] CAM-1:  “They were asking about the American.”  
[21:17:30] TWR:    Avianca 052, can you increase by 10 kt?  
[21:17:40] CAM-1:  “10?”  
[21:17:41] RDO-?:  “Okay, +10 kt.”  
[21:17:42] TWR:    “Increase! Increase!”  
[21:17:42] CAM-1:  “What?”

[21:17:45] CAM-1:  “What?”  
[21:17:46] TWR:    “Okay.”  
[21:17:46] CAM-3:  “+10 kt more.”  
[21:17:48] CAM-2:  “Ten little knots more.”  
[21:17:48] CAM-3:  “Ten little knots more.”  
[21:17:48] CAM-1:  “150.”  
[21:17:52] CAM-1:  “Here we go.”  
[21:17:55] CAM-1:  “Speak louder—I can’t hear.”  
[21:18:11] CAM-2:  “3 nm to the outer marker.”  
[21:18:13] CAM-1:  “Right.”  
[21:18:15] CAM-1:  “Resetting the ILS.”  
[21:18:17] CAM-2:  “Already intercepted.”

[21:19:43] CAM-3:  “Spoiler switches?”  
[21:19:45] CAM-2:  “On.”
