<h2>KLM 4805</h2>
18:07:49  RDO-2: Tenerife, Clipper 1736.
18:08:01  APP: Clipper 1736, Tenerife.
18:08:03  RDO-2: We were instructed to contact you and also taxi down the runway—is that correct?
18:08:08  APP: Affirmative. Taxi onto the runway and leave at the third exit to your left.
18:08:16  RDO-2: Third to the left, OK.
18:08:18  CAM-3: Third, he said.
18:08:18  CAM-?: Three.
18:08:20  APP: Third one to your left.
18:08:21  CAM-1: I think he said first.
18:08:26  CAM-2: I’ll ask him again.
18:08:32  CAM-2: Left turn.
18:08:33  CAM-1: I don’t think they have takeoff minimums anywhere right now.
18:08:39  CAM-1: What really happened over there today?
18:08:41  CAM-4: They put a bomb in the terminal, sir—right where the check-in counters are.
18:08:46  CAM-1: Well, we asked if we could hold—guess you got the word—we landed here.
18:08:49  APP: KLM4805, how many taxiways did you pass?
18:08:55  KLM: I think we just passed Charlie Four now.
18:08:59  APP: Okay… at the end of the runway make 180° and report ready for ATC clearance.
18:09:09  CAM-2: The first one is a 90° turn.
18:09:11  CAM-1: Yeah, OK.
18:09:12  CAM-2: Must be the third… I’ll ask him again.
18:09:14  CAM-1: OK.
18:09:16  CAM-1: We could probably go in—it’s a 90°.
18:09:19  CAM-1: You gotta make a 90° turn.
18:09:21  CAM-2: 90° to get around this one down here—it’s a 45°.
18:09:29  RDO-2: Confirm you want Clipper 1736 to turn left at the third intersection?
18:09:35  CAM-1: One, two.
18:09:36  APP: The third one, sir—one, two, three: that one.
18:09:38  CAM-?: One two (four).
18:09:39  CAM-1: Good.
18:09:40  CAM-1: That’s what we need, the third one.
18:09:42  CAM-3: Uno, dos, tres.
18:09:44  CAM-1: Uno, dos, tres.
18:09:44  CAM-3: Tres—uh—sí.
18:09:46  CAM-1: Right.
18:09:47  CAM-3: We’ll make it yet.
18:09:47  APP: Clipper 1736, report leaving the runway.
18:09:49  CAM-2: Wing flaps?
18:09:50  CAM-1: Ten—indicate ten. Leading-edge lights green.
18:09:54  CAM-?: Get that.
18:09:55  RDO-2: Clipper 1736.
18:09:56  CAM-2: Yaw damp and instruments?
18:09:58  CAM-1: Ah, Bob—we’ll get a left one…
18:09:59  CAM-2: I got a left.
18:10:00  CAM-1: Did you?
18:10:00  CAM-2: And—ah—you need a right.
18:10:02  CAM-1: I’ll give you a little…
18:10:03  CAM-2: Put a little aileron in this thing.
18:10:05  CAM-1: OK, here’s a left and I’ll give you a right right here.
18:10:09  CAM-1: OK, right turn, right and left yaw.
18:10:11  CAM-2: Left yaw checks.
18:10:12  CAM-1: OK, here’s the rudders.
18:10:13  CAM-1: Two left center, two right center.
18:10:17  CAM-2: Checks.
18:10:19  CAM-2: Controls.
18:10:19  CAM-1: Haven’t seen any yet.
18:10:20  CAM-2: I haven’t either.
18:10:21  CAM-1: They’re free, indicators checked.
18:10:24  CAM-2: There’s one.
18:10:25  CAM-1: There’s one.
18:10:26  CAM-1: That’s the 90°.
18:10:28  CAM-?: OK.
18:10:34  CAM-?: ***
18:10:34  CAM-2: Weight-and-balance finals?
18:10:37  CAM: [stabilizer-trim sounds]
18:10:37  CAM-1: We were gonna put that on four-and-a-half.
18:10:39  CAM-3: We got four-and-a-half and we weigh 534. [trim sound]
18:10:44  CAM-2: Four-and-a-half on the right.
18:10:46  CAM-2: Engineer’s taxi check.
18:10:48  CAM-3: Taxi check complete.
18:10:50  CAM-2: Take-off and departure briefing?
18:10:52  CAM-1: OK—it’ll be standard. We’ll go straight out until 3,500 then reverse and go back out to Sector 14.
18:10:58  APP: KLM 4805 and Clipper 1736—for information, centerline lights are out of service.
18:11:05  KLM: I copied that.
18:11:07  RDO-2: Clipper 1736.
18:11:09  CAM-1: We got centerline markings… we need 800 m if you don’t have that centerline… read that a while ago.
18:11:22  CAM-1: That’s two.
18:11:23  CAM-3: Yeah, that’s 45° there.
18:11:25  CAM-1: Yeah.
18:11:26  CAM-2: That’s this one here.
18:11:27  CAM-1: Yeah, but it goes ahead—gonna put us on the taxiway.
18:11:28  CAM-3: Yeah, just a little bit, yeah.
18:11:39  CAM-?: OK, for sure.
18:11:40  CAM-2: Maybe he counts these three.
18:11:44  CAM-?: Huh?
18:11:44  KLM: Clipper 4805 is now ready for takeoff—we’re waiting ATC clearance.
18:11:53  APP: KLM 4805 and Clipper 1736—you are cleared to Papa Beacon, climb to FL 090, right turn out heading 040, intercept 325° radial from Las Palmas VOR.
18:12:09  KLM: Roger, cleared to Papa Beacon FL 090, right 040, intercept 325.
18:12:13  KLM-1: We gaan.
18:12:18  APP: OK.
18:12:19  RDO: No… eh.
18:12:20  APP: Stand by for take-off, I will call you.
18:12:20  RDO: And we’re still taxiing down the runway, Clipper 1736.
18:12:20  RDO & APP comms caused shrill noise—messages not heard by KLM crew.
18:12:25  APP: Roger 1736, report when runway clear.
18:12:29  RDO: OK, will report when clear.
18:12:29  APP: Thank you.
18:12:32  KLM-3: Is hij er niet af dan?
18:12:34  KLM-1: Wat zeg je?
18:12:34  KLM-?: Yup.
18:12:34  KLM-3: Is hij er niet af, die Pan Am?
18:12:35  KLM-1: Jawel.
18:12:40  Pan Am captain sees KLM landing lights at approx 700 m.
18:12:44  PH-BUF started rotation.
18:12:47  KLM-1: [scream]
18:12:50  [collision]
