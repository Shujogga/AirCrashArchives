<h2>KLM 4805, PANAM 1736</h2>

17:01:57  PANAM-RADIO    Tenerife, the Clipper one seven three six.  
17:02:01  ATC:            Clipper one seven three six, Tenerife.  
17:02:03  PANAM-RADIO    Ah—We were instructed to contact you and also to taxi down the runway, is that correct?  
17:02:08  ATC:            Affirmative, taxi onto the runway and leave at the third exit to your left.  
17:02:16  PANAM-RADIO    Third to the left, OK.  
17:02:18  KLM-CAM-3      Third, he said.  
17:02:18  CAM-?          Three.  
17:02:20  ATC:            …third one to your left.  
17:02:21  KLM-CAM-1      I think he said first.  
17:02:26  KLM-CAM-2      I’ll ask him again.  
                CAM-?          * * *  
17:02:32  KLM-CAM-2      Left turn.  
17:02:33  KLM-CAM-1      I don’t think they have takeoff minimums anywhere right now.  
17:02:39  KLM-CAM-1      What really happened over there today?  
17:02:41  KLM-CAM-3      They put a bomb in the terminal, Sir, right where the check-in counters are.  
17:02:46  KLM-CAM-1      Well, we asked if we could hold—and I guess you got the word—we landed here…  
17:02:47  CAM-?          * * *  
17:02:49  ATC:           KLM 4805, how many taxiways did you pass?  
17:02:55  KLM-RADIO      I think we just passed Charlie Four now.  
17:02:59  ATC:           OK… at the end of the runway make 180° and report ready for ATC clearance.  
17:03:09  KLM-CAM-2      The first one is a ninety-degree turn.  
17:03:11  KLM-CAM-1      Yeah, OK.  
17:03:12  KLM-CAM-2      Must be the third… I’ll ask him again.  
17:03:14  KLM-CAM-1      OK.  
17:03:16  KLM-CAM-1      We could probably go in—it’s a ninety.  
17:03:19  KLM-CAM-1      You gotta make a ninety-degree turn.  
17:03:21  KLM-CAM-1      Yeah, uh…  
17:03:21  KLM-CAM-2      Ninety to get around this one down here—it’s a forty-five.  
17:03:29  PANAM-RADIO    Would you confirm you want Clipper 1736 to turn left at the third intersection?  
17:03:35  KLM-CAM-1      One, two.  
17:03:36  ATC:           The third one, sir—one, two, three: that one.  
17:03:38  CAM-?          One two (four).  
17:03:39  KLM-CAM-1      Good.  
17:03:40  KLM-CAM-1      That’s what we need—the third one.  
17:03:42  KLM-CAM-3      Uno, dos, tres.  
17:03:44  KLM-CAM-1      Uno, dos, tres.  
17:03:44  KLM-CAM-3      Tres—uh—sí.  
17:03:46  KLM-CAM-1      Right.  
17:03:47  KLM-CAM-3      We’ll make it yet.  
17:03:47  ATC:           …er 1736, report leaving the runway.  
17:03:49  KLM-CAM-2      Wing flaps?  
17:03:50  KLM-CAM-1      Ten—indicated ten. Leading-edge lights green.  
17:03:54  CAM-?          Get that.  
17:03:55  PANAM-RADIO    Clipper 1736.  
17:03:56  KLM-CAM-2      Yaw damp and instruments?  
17:03:58  KLM-CAM-1      Ah—Bob, we’ll get a left one…  
17:03:59  KLM-CAM-2      I got a left.  
17:04:00  KLM-CAM-1      Did you?  
17:04:01  KLM-CAM-2      And—ah—need a right.  
17:04:02  KLM-CAM-1      I’ll give you a little…  
17:04:03  KLM-CAM-2      Put a little aileron in this thing.  
17:04:05  KLM-CAM-1      OK, here’s a left—and I’ll give you a right one right here.  
17:04:09  KLM-CAM-1      OK, right turn; right and left yaw.  
17:04:11  KLM-CAM-2      Left yaw checks.  
17:04:12  KLM-CAM-1      OK, here’s the rudders.  
17:04:13  KLM-CAM-1      Two left-center, two right-center.  
17:04:17  KLM-CAM-2      Checks.  
17:04:19  KLM-CAM-2      Controls.  
17:04:20  KLM-CAM-1      Haven’t seen any yet!  
17:04:20  KLM-CAM-2      I haven’t either.  
17:04:21  KLM-CAM-1      They’re free—the indicators are checked.  
17:04:24  KLM-CAM-2      There’s one.  
17:04:25  KLM-CAM-1      There’s one.  
17:04:26  KLM-CAM-1      That’s the ninety-degree.  
17:04:28  CAM-?          OK.  
17:04:34  CAM-?          ***  
17:04:37  CAM            [stabilizer-trim sounds]  
17:04:37  KLM-CAM-1      We were gonna put that on four-and-a-half.  
17:04:39  KLM-CAM-3      We got four-and-a-half and we weigh five-thirty-four. [trim sound]  
17:04:44  KLM-CAM-2      Four-and-a-half on the right.  
17:04:46  KLM-CAM-2      Engineer’s taxi check.  
17:04:48  KLM-CAM-3      Taxi check complete.  
17:04:50  KLM-CAM-2      Take-off and departure briefing?  
17:04:52  KLM-CAM-1      OK—it’ll be standard. We’ll go straight out until 3,500 ft then reverse back out to Sector 14.  
17:04:58  ATC:           …for your information, centerline lighting is out of service.  
17:05:05  KLM-RADIO      I copied that.  
17:05:07  PANAM-RADIO    Clipper 1736.  
17:05:09  KLM-CAM-1      We got centerline markings (only)—they count the same. We need 800 m if you don’t have that centerline.  
17:05:22  KLM-CAM-1      That’s two.  
17:05:23  KLM-CAM-3      Yeah—that’s forty-five there.  
17:05:25  KLM-CAM-1      Yeah.  
17:05:26  KLM-CAM-2      That’s this one here.  
17:05:27  KLM-CAM-1      Yeah—I know.  
17:05:28  KLM-CAM-3      OK.  
17:05:28  KLM-CAM-3      Next one is almost a forty-five, yeah.  
17:05:30  KLM-CAM-1      But it goes ahead—it’s gonna put us on the taxiway.  
17:05:35  KLM-CAM-3      Yeah—just a little bit, yeah.  
17:05:39  CAM-?          OK, for sure.  
17:05:40  KLM-CAM-2      Maybe he counts these as three.  
17:05:44  CAM-?          Huh.  
17:05:44  KLM-CAM-3      I like this.  
17:05:45  KLM-RADIO      The KLM 4805 is now ready for take-off… we’re waiting clearance.  
17:05:53  ATC:           KLM 4805—cleared to Papa Beacon, climb to FL 090; right turn out heading 040, intercept 325° radial from LPG VOR.  
17:06:09  KLM-RADIO      Roger—climb to 090, right 040 until intercept 325.  
17:06:13  KLM-CAM-1      We gaan. [We’re going.]  
17:06:18  ATC:           OK.  
17:06:19  PANAM-RADIO    No… eh…  
17:06:20  ATC:           Stand by for take-off, I will call you.  
17:06:20  PANAM-RADIO    We’re still taxiing down the runway, Clipper 1736.  
17:06:23  CAM-?          [shrill noise—comms masked]  
17:06:25  ATC:           Roger 1736, report when runway clear.  
17:06:29  PANAM-RADIO    OK, will report when clear.  
17:06:29  ATC:           Thank you.  
17:06:32  KLM-CAM-3      Is hij er niet af dan? {Is he not clear then?}  
17:06:34  KLM-CAM-1      Wat zeg je? {What did you say?}  
17:06:34  KLM-CAM-?      Yup.  
17:06:34  KLM-CAM-3      Is hij er niet af, die Pan American? {Is Pan Am not clear?}  
17:06:35  KLM-CAM-1      Jawel. {Oh yes.}  
17:06:38  PANAM-CAM-2    What’s that right there?  
17:06:40  PANAM-CAM-1   There he is… look at him. Goddamn that son-of-a-bitch is coming straight at us!  
17:06:44  PH-BUF         [rotation sounds begin]  
17:06:47  KLM-CAM-1     [Scream]  
17:06:50  —              Collision
