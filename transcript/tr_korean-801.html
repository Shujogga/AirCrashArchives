[15:38:20] CERAP: “That’s what I show.”  
[15:38:22] LC: “All right, thanks.”  

[15:39:23] CERAP: “km.”  

[15:41:07] KAL801: “Agana Tower, Korean Air eight zero one, ah… localizer six left.”  
[15:41:14] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy, Agana Tower. Runway six left, wind zero niner zero at seven. Cleared to land. Verify heavy Boeing 747-400.”  
[15:41:26] KAL801: “Korean Air eight zero one, roger (unintelligible) six left.”  
[15:41:30] LC: “Roger.”  

[15:44:02] CERAP: “Was that nine eighty-eight you’re looking for?”  
[15:44:07] LC: “Say again?”  
[15:44:09] CERAP: “Guam to Saipan—is that nine eighty-eight?”  
[15:44:11] LC: “Affirmative.”  
[15:44:12] CERAP: “Yeah, I think we lost a flight plan so I’m gonna make one up here… oops.”  
[15:44:18] LC: “He hadn’t called me yet, so they may not have put it in either. They may have cancelled it.”  
[15:44:23] CERAP: “OK.”  
[15:44:24] LC: “Why don’t we just hold off till he calls for it?”  
[15:44:26] CERAP: “km.”  
[15:44:28] LC: “to.”  

[15:45:25] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy, tower—how do you hear?”  

[15:47:03] RAMP (Juan): “This is Juan.”  
[15:47:05] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy—aircraft change on the type. Is that permanent?”  
[15:47:11] RAMP: “No, that’s just temporary. Their normal is an Airbus, they have more passengers this time.”

[15:49:51] RAMP: “This is Juan.”  
[15:49:52] LC: “Yeah, Korean Air—coming up to you?”  
[15:49:53] RAMP: “No.”  
[15:49:54] LC: “All right, thanks.”  
[15:49:56] LC: “Approach Agana.”  

[15:50:15] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy, Agana Tower.”  
[15:50:23] LC: “Approach Agana—did Korean Air come back to you?”  
[15:50:28] CERAP: “Eight zero one.”  
[15:50:29] LC: “Affirmative?”  
[15:50:35] CERAP: “No.”  
[15:50:35] LC: “I cleared him to land; I don’t know where he is—never had him in sight.”  
[15:50:41] RAMP: “You never saw him?”  
[15:50:45] CERAP: “He didn’t land.”  
[15:50:46] LC: “Negative.”  
[15:50:50] CERAP: “Oh my God.”  
[15:50:52] LC: “Stand by a second.”  

[15:50:58] RAMP: “This is Juan.”  
[15:51:00] LC: “Yeah—did Korean Air…?”  
[15:51:01] RAMP: “No. In fact I’m listening to CERAP; I don’t even hear eight zero one. I can hear you on the radio.”  
[15:51:06] LC: “I tried to get hold of him after clearing him to land.”  
[15:51:10] LC: “I never had him in sight.”  
[15:51:11] RAMP: “I was looking around—where’s he at?”  
[15:51:14] LC: “Hold on. Andersen Tower, Agana Tower.”  
[15:51:18] CERAP: “Don’t see him on radar.”  
[15:51:27] LC: “Stand by—checking.”  
[15:51:30] Andersen Tower: “Go ahead.”  
[15:51:31] LC: “You didn’t have a 747-400 land there, did you?”  
[15:51:35] Andersen: “Just now?”  
[15:51:36] LC: “Affirmative.”  
[15:51:37] Andersen: “No lights—don’t see anybody out there.”  
[15:51:41] LC: “We’re missing a Boeing 747-400—stand by.”  
[15:51:45] LC: “Checked with Andersen—they don’t know where he is either.”  
[15:51:49] CERAP: “Is it raining out there?”  
[15:51:50] LC: “Wet runway, small shower pushing through. I can see approach end—stand by.”  

[15:52:04] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy, Agana Tower.”  
[15:52:16] LC: “Is that him talking to you?”  
[15:52:19] CERAP: “Negative.”  
[15:52:26] LC: “He called once—I cleared him to land, told him not in sight. Now I don’t have him.”  
[15:52:34] CERAP: “Well, he must have crashed then.”  
[15:52:38] LC: “Agana Tower, Korean Air eight zero one heavy.”  
[15:52:45] CERAP: “I’ll talk to you later.”  
[15:52:47] LC: “You there? I don’t have him—losing visibility with the shower.”  

[15:53:22] RAMP: “*(lost him)*”  
[15:53:24] LC: “Why? We don’t know where he is—still looking.”  
[15:53:27] RAMP: “What about CERAP?”  
[15:53:28] LC: “Center doesn’t have him on radar.”  
[15:53:33] RAMP: “Last we heard he was about ten out.”  
[15:53:38] LC: “He hasn’t called on my frequency.”  
[15:53:47] RAMP: “No.”  
[15:53:48] LC: “All right, thanks.”  

[15:53:50] LC: “Approach Agana.”  
[15:53:55] CERAP: “Center.”  
[15:53:56] LC: “Just checked with ramp—they haven’t had contact either.”  
[15:54:02] CERAP: “He must have crashed west of the airport.”  
[15:54:08] LC: “He was about twelve out when transferred to me.”  
[15:54:14] LC: “I don’t have him—no comm.”  
[15:54:18] CERAP: “Send search west of the airport.”  
[15:54:25] LC: “Who’s inbound?”  
[15:54:27] CERAP: “I’ll ask Ryan.”  
[15:54:30] LC: “Korean Air eight zero one heavy, Agana Tower.”  

[15:55:10] CERAP: “Tower, center inbound.”  
[15:55:13] LC: “Agana Tower.”  
[15:55:14] CERAP: “Six south, Ryan seven eighty nine, visual runway six left, km.”  
[15:55:17] LC: “Is he able to go out and look?”  
[15:55:19] CERAP: “Yeah, he’s looking now.”  
[15:55:26] LC: “Thanks.”  
[15:55:28] LC: “Tower.”  
[15:55:28] RAMP: “Is that him behind you?”  
[15:55:29] LC: “No—that’s Ryan.”  
[15:55:31] RAMP: “Oh, that’s Ryan coming in now.”  
[15:55:32] LC: “Affirmative.”  
[15:55:33] RAMP: “OK.”
