      <h3>🔍 Key Factors</h3>
      <p>The aircraft was on an unstable approach — too high and fast. Despite ATC warnings, the crew continued. Landing gear was retracted at 1,740 ft, and the aircraft touched down on its engines. A go-around was initiated, but both engines failed due to damage. The aircraft crashed 1,340 m short of the runway during the second approach.</p>

      <h3>🎙️ Cockpit Voice & Flight Data</h3>
      <blockquote>“We are comfortable now… established ILS 25L.” — First Officer</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Mayday, Mayday, Mayday — we have lost engines.” — Captain</blockquote>
      <p>The CVR revealed non-operational chatter during approach and lack of checklist discipline. The FDR showed gear retraction before touchdown and engine parameters degrading post-impact. Both recorders were recovered and analyzed by AAIB Pakistan, BEA France, and NTSB USA.</p>
